# Dognition-Analysis
Dognition is a website that has multiple tests for dogs. The tests measure different personality aspects for each dog. These aspects are called dimensions and each group of tests measures one dimension.
The given data is related to dogs (such as breed type, age, gender, weight, breed group ...) and their owners (city, location, membership type...etc).
The main point of interest to the company is how to increase the number of users/dogs who complete tests.
I'm given SQL database and Excel sheets that contain all the data the website collects during the period 2013-2015.
I'll use SQL and Tableau to get insights about how to increase the number of completed tests.
The analysis plan is attached, SQL code files are uploaded and a Tableau viz link will be provided.
